            <p>
                I will provide value to your business, learning more each day so that I can provide even greater returns tomorrow. I have experience dealing with clients and other members of the public where my qualifications help me to explain the software I have used and created. Understanding a system is the first step towards mimicking or improving it and there is nothing I love more than learning about how things work.

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
                        <p>Having been self employed, running my own businesses on a small, isolated island I have had to be resourceful and independent when it comes to solving problems. First I gain a good understanding of what caused the problem so that I can solve it in a way that will prevent it recurring or new issues from arising because of the solution. Large problems can seem daunting to tackle at first but I have yet to find an issue that cannot be broken down into smaller tasks which can be approached one at a time. Sometimes it is not the solution that is the challenge but identifying the fault, having a methodical approach is as important when fixing a broken diesel boat engine as it is when debugging code.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Programming</h3>
                        <p>My degree focused on programming in C++ but by the final year we were computer linguists, having learned to understand a broad range of programming principles. Since university I have used many web technologies to produce dynamic websites and tools. (Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Node.js, React) In my spare time I have been using Unity and C# to create simple games for my children.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Teamwork</h3>
                        <p>Sitting as an elected member on a Unitary Authority Council I work closely with other members and officers to take shared responsibility for setting a balanced revenue budget whilst being responsible for delivering a broad range of services including adult's social care, children's social care, environmental health, licensing, planning, health overview and scrutiny, waste and recycling. In addition to my main responsibilities, I also represent the Council on the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Association, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Nature Partnership, Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Partnership, South West Regional Flood and Coastal Committee and I chair the Climate Change Working Group.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Teaching</h3>
                        <p>I have always helped people to understand complex concepts and learn in a way that works for them, focusing on retention of knowledge and skills built on a good foundation of the subject. Taking the PTLLS level 4 course really helped me to expand and demonstrate my teaching skills which I put into practice writing and teaching beginner and intermediate spreadsheet courses as well as an introduction to computing course for over 50s. I also enjoyed tutoring a high school student in HTML and Javascript focusing on basic programming techniques, he has gone on to get distinction stars at College and secured a place on a computer science degree at Nottingham University.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>In my role as a councillor it is important to communicate well, in a professional manner with a wide range of people, such as members of the public, Council Officers, other elected members and colleagues from other organisations. I sit on the Communications Working Group where we discuss how Council Comms policy should be applied to current news items. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Customer Service</h3>
                        <p>Having worked in retail I have experience dealing with a wide range of customers. I have also worked in a technical support capacity where I provided members of the public with IT support on their own devices at drop in sessions, I was also able to use my teaching skills at these sessions to explain how to use various software to achieve what the customer wanted.</p>
