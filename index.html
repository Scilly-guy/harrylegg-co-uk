            </div>
            <p>
              For my main navbar I decided to use a fixed position so that the
              options are always available to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the left I have added colour scheme choice buttons, these work
              by adding a class of light or dark to the html element, each class
              contains the css variables to effect the theme change. I have
              utilised local storage to save the prefered theme between site
              visits, also on the first visit the theme is selected based on the
              users prefered theme settings, defaulting to dark if they have no
              preference.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scroll behavior of the Projects and Contact links is dependant
              on the users &lt;Prefers Reduced Motion&gt; flag, I have tried to
              respect the reduced motion flag with every animation, please let
              me know if you think I missed anything.

              I created my Hero text using a caligraphy font which I vectorised
              and adapted to my liking. I made each letter its own path and
              setup an animation to rotate the hue, I started the animation
              staggered using a negative delay, each letter is 1.5s behind the
              preceeding one. By setting it to 15s for a complete cycle I think
              the effect is subtle enough not to warrant a &lt;prefers reduced
              motion&gt; opt out, but encourage you to contact me if you
              disagree.

              I have used a grid to display my skills, I have used a
              grid-template-columns repeat(auto-fit,minmax(80px, 1fr)) to ensure
              this displays responsively. In fact I have not used an media
              queries to achieve the responsiveness of my website.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to include React and Typescript but clarify that I am
              still in the process of learning them. I apply a blur filter to
              the img child of the comingsoon class, and use a pseudo after
              element to add the coming soon text which has a text-shadow to
              increase its legibility. I have also used a greyscale filter to
              dull down the comingsoon logos.
            </p>
            <p>
              For my Resum√© page I decided to recreate my resum√© in html and
              make it look as though it is on two sheets of paper on a wooden
              desk. The animation I added was one of the most straight forward
              aspects of the entire site proportionally to its impact. I decided
              to add the phone, coffee stain and polaroids to enhance the 'desk'
              effect, notice that the time on the phone is correct
              (&plusmn;1min) and if you move it around the wifi and mobile
              signal change. If you are viewing my resum√© on a phone it will
              take up the entire screen width but you may catch a glimpse of a
              polaroid between the pages, hopefully encouraging you to view it
              as it was designed to be seen, on a desktop.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted to implement a page transition when navigating to my
              resum√© page, I have used SWUP to achieve this. Implementing SWUP
              lead me to refactor several aspects and was more effort than I
              feel it was worth but something I am glad to have done as I
              learned a lot in the process. It also lead me to preload the
              background (another AI generated seamless texture) to improve the
              user experience.

                  I have not used any templates, I have tried to demonstrate an
                  understanding of a range of techniques and effects. I recently
                  added SWUP to my tech stack to include transitions between
                  pages, I hope to build on these in the future.

                <p>
                  This was an app I made for a job interview at Radical. The
                  challenge was to create CRUD API which provided access to the
                  New York Times Best Sellers lists and allowed the user to give
                  the books ratings (or not) and enter them into a database
                  stored locally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an optional extra I chose to create a front end to
                  demonstrate the API as well but it was also possible to just
                  run the API and test it with Swagger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I used EntityFrameworkCore for the database interface and
                  ASP.NET MVC framework for the frontend. Interactive elements
                  were handled using jquery and styling was done with Bootstrap.
                </p>

                  This app loads random images from picsum so will appear
                  different each time you load the page. This is different from
                  the course version of the project because their hero image was
                  a single static image where as I have used CSS to recreate the
                  original design. The data for the cards is stored in an array
                  to mimic data coming from an api.

                  I haven't yet finished this game to a point I am satisfied to

                  It is a recreation of a DOS game from 1993 that I got on a
                  cover disk all of those moons ago. The original game was
                  create by Patrick Piche and I have tried to recreate the
                  atmosphere of the original using a modern game engine. It was
                  after I started the project that I happened to discover that
                  Patrick Piche now works for Unity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have also created an animal grazing simulation which used a
                  neural network for the animals to find food and avoid the edge
                  of the map, this was trained using a genetic algorithm
                  adjusting the weights randomly each generation. I found neural
                  networks to be surprisingly straight forward but I am not
                  interested in persuing AI per se.

              The background for this section was created using a Stable
              Diffusion Plugin in Blender, this AI image generator can produce
              borderless textures which can be used for tiled backgrounds. I
              have then added a Linear gradient on top of the image so it is not
              so bright in dark mode and not so busy in light mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              The top and bottom of this section are wavy, I achieved this by
              creating a wave profile SVG which I used to mask the background in
              a before and after pseudo element of the section element. I sized
              them so that there are
              <button id="decreaseWaveCount" class="click-to-change">-</button
              ><span id="waveCount">5</span
              ><button id="increaseWaveCount" class="click-to-change">+</button>
              waves across the windows width.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the cards I have made them clickable so that they transition
              to absolute positioned elements which migrate to the top of the
              current scroll location and the width increases to the smaller of
              the dynamic screen width or a given width. I actually clone the
              element and hide the original to avoid affecting the layout of the
              other elements. I wanted to demonstrate an understanding of how to
              achieve this but if I was doing this again I would utilise an
              existing library (such as animate.js) for animating elements.

                Harry has been fantastic with transferring my website from one
                website hosting provider to another. He understood my
                frustrations with my current site and was able to iron them out
                on the new one without compromising the layout and look of the
                site.
              </p>
              <p>
                He was brilliant at talking me through what he was doing and
                made the technical information much easier to digest for someone
                who is not IT literate.
              </p>
              <p>
                He kept me posted on how he was doing and what he was doing
                which is super useful for when I need to make small changes
                myself. And very proactive to tinker with things to make them
                work just how I imagined.
              </p>
              <p>
                Super grateful for everything he has done and for his patience.

              I used the semantic address element for marking up my contact
              details, my phone number is a tel link and email address is a
              mailto link. Personally I prefer not to use mailto links so I also
              added a button to copy the email address to clipboard using the JS
              clipboard API, for feedback I toggle the visibility of the tick
              path on the clipboard icon svg.
            </p>
            <p>
              The contact form sends its contents to a PHP script that uses the
              PHPMailer library to send the email. I added some CSS transitions
              to the labels which are positioned absolutely so they appear
              inside the input fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              This section has a slanted background, I created this effect by
              adding an absolutely positioned after pseudo element to the
              section element, I gave it an inset of 0 so that it is the same
              size and position but then used a skewY transform to get the
              slanted effect.

              I created these trophies using DALL¬∑E 2 for the original designs
              (except the mystery trophy which is 100% my own work), which I
              then vectorised using Inkscape and animated by adding relevant CSS
              directly to the code. The animation only plays if the user does
              not have the &lt;prefers reduced motion&gt; flag set. The
              Programmer trophy was the most complicated due to all of the keys,
              I was also unable to use a mesh gradient as these aren't yet
              supported by browsers so I came up with a work around of using 4
              linear gradients.

              for pointerDown on the respective links, it would be a breach of
              privacy to confirm that the user has visited the link. I
              specifically made it so that even right clicking is considered
              acceptable to gain the achievement (incase someone right clicks
              and selects open in new tab/window). The Recruiter achievement
              requires two actions: visiting my Resum√© page and some sort of
              email interaction (using the copy email address button is enough).
              The Collector achievement is awarded for collecting the 5
              preceeding achievements. Which includes the Gamer achievement
              which currently cannot be achieved as I haven't created a games
              page yet (check back soon for this). The Inspector achievement is
              awarded when the browsers inspection window is opened (for at
              least 2 seconds), I implemented this using Sindre Sorhus' code
              from GitHub. The final achievement remains a mystery, although
              anyone who inspects the code can easily achieve this if they work
              out how.

              If you hover over each trophy the title text will tell you how
              many people have achieved this. I wrote a PHP script to store the
              count for each achievement in a file on the server, this is
              updated using AJAX when someone achieves a new trophy. I could
              have used a database but felt that would have been overkill.

              I added a notification and feedback events when each achievement
              is awarded, I use fireworks.js and party.js, and randomly choose
              one of 3 effects for each achievement. Each time an achievement is
              awarded I reset the timer and update the notification to include
              the awards that are currently being celebrated, ensuring the last
              comma is replaced with an '&amp;'. How many can you get at once?
